= Wayk Den PowerShell Cmdlet

WaykDen-ps is a PowerShell cmdlet for Wayk Den, the centralized server for https://wayk.devolutions.net[Devolutions Wayk Now]. For assistance or feature requests, please use the https://forum.devolutions.net/#WaykNow[Wayk Now forums] or open a ticket on this github project.

== Installation

=== PowerShell Core
On Windows, the regular PowerShell already installed can be used. On macOS and Linux, you need PowerShell Core 6.0:

PowerShell Core 6.0::
https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell

To launch a PowerShell Core terminal, use the `pwsh` command.

=== Wayk Den PowerShell module
A powershell module is available to configure and manage the Wayk Den server. It is available on PSGallery or it could be built directly from https://github.com/Devolutions/WaykDen-ps[source code]. We recommand to install the latest version available on PSGallery, but if needed, a section describe how to build it if you need it.

==== Installation from PSGallery

The Wayk Den PowerShell module is https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/WaykDen[available on PSGallery].

[source,sh]
----
Install-Module -Name WaykDen -AllowPrerelease
Import-Module WaykDen
----

If you encounter issues with the `Install-Module` command, you may have to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/powershell/gallery/installing-psget[install or update PowerShellGet].

You can then list all commands exported from the `WaykDen` module:

[source,sh]
----
Get-Command -Module WaykDen
----

==== Installation from Source

If you have installed the module from PSGallery, this section is not useful for you. You can jump to the next section. 

To build the Cmdlet, you will need the .NET Core 2.2 SDK and the .NET Framework 4.7.2 SDK. The latter is only needed if you want to support PowerShell for Windows.

 .NET Core 2.2 SDK::
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

 .NET Framework 4.7.2 SDK::
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472

From PowerShell, run the build.ps1 script, and then load the resulting PowerShell module:

[source,sh]
----
.\build.ps1
Import-Module "./WaykDen" -Force
----

=== Docker Installation

Wayk Den is composed of multiple microservices running inside Docker containers. The PowerShell cmdlet simplifies the usage of Docker for users not familiar with it. For more advanced users, the cmdlet can export a usable docker-compose configuration file.

The current version of Wayk Den requires support for Linux containers and bind mounts. Windows containers will be supported in the future.

On Windows, the recommended option is to use https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows[Docker Desktop for Windows]. This version of Docker requires Hyper-V for Linux container support.

For bind mount support with Linux containers on Windows, you need to go in the Docker settings and https://rominirani.com/docker-on-windows-mounting-host-directories-d96f3f056a2c[select the required drives from the "Shared Drives" section].

On macOS and Linux, follow the instructions here to install Docker CE correctly. It is recommended to use the official Docker packages instead as documented in the https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker install page].

On Linux, do not forget to https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/[add your user to the docker group] after installation.

To confirm that Docker is up and running, use the `docker run hello-world` command. If you don't see the "Hello from Docker!" message, something is wrong with your Docker installation.

== Configuration

The first step is to create a Wayk Den configuration file with mandatory parameters using the `New-WaykDenConfig` command.

You need to choose a realm for your Wayk Den, such as "contoso.net". This realm does not need to be a valid DNS domain name, but it will become your Wayk Den realm used in various places, including the peer-to-peer certificates generated by the Wayk Den built-in certificate authority.

The second mandatory parameter is the external URL at which the Wayk Den will be exposed. We recommend using the "den" subdomain under the domain of your choice, such as "den.contoso.net". The protocol prefix (`http://` or `https://`) also needs to be included.

Create a new Wayk Den configuration file, using "contoso.net" as realm and "https://den.contoso.net" as the external url:

[source, sh]
----
PS > New-WaykDenConfig -Realm contoso.net -ExternalUrl https://den.contoso.net
----

=== Certificate configuration

To expose Wayk Den to the external world, you will need a TLS certificate from a trusted certificate authority such as https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt]. Wayk Now will validate certificates in the same way as a browser does for a website.

If you wish to make your own certificate authority, the Root CA certificate will need to be installed in each machine's certificate trust store. If the system browser can validate it, Wayk Now should be able to validate it as well, it's just a lot more work.

Before going any further, check the following points:

1. The certificate name matches your configured external URL. This means that if your external URL is "https://den.contoso.com" then your certificate name should be "den.contoso.com" or "*.contoso.com" if you have a wildcard certificate.

2. The certificate is either in pem + key or pfx (PKCS#12) format. The private key password is only supported for the pfx format.

3. The certificate file contains the certificate *chain* excluding the Root CA. This means that in most cases, you should have a leaf certificate, followed by one or more intermediate certificates. If validation works in a browser but not in Wayk Now, the intermediate certificate is likely missing.

The PEM format is the simplest to work with, since it is the Base64 representation of the DER-encoded certificate in between "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" tags. To add the intermediate certificate to the certificate file, just append it after your leaf certificate in a text editor.

[source, sh]
----
PS > Set-WaykDenWebCertificate -CertificatePath /path/to/certificate.pem -PrivateKeyPath /path/to/private_key.key
----

[source, sh]
----
PS > Set-WaykDenWebCertificate -CertificatePath /path/to/certificate.pfx -KeyPassword <password>
----

== Running

Start Wayk Den, and wait for all microservices to start:

[source, sh]
----
PS > Start-WaykDen
----

Once started, Wayk Den listens on http://localhost:4000 by default. We recommend using a reverse tunnel such as https://ngrok.com/[ngrok] or https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/products/argo-tunnel/[argo tunnels] from Cloudflare. In this case, a tunnel is used to expose localhost:4000 on the den.contoso.net external url.

You can check that all containers are up and running with the `docker ps -f network=den-network` command.

To confirm everything is correctly configured, you should be able to get a response from the Wayk Den well known configuration endpoint:

[source, sh]
----
curl http://localhost:4000/.well-known/configuration
{"den_router_uri":"https://den.contoso.net/cow","lucid_uri":"https://den.contoso.net/lucid","realm":"contoso.net","wayk_client_id":"zqdvSbCRWdDrj1fQXwzPQbCg"}
----

If you have correctly configured external access, you should be able to get the same response using the external configuration URL (https://den.contoso.net/.well-known/configuration).

Stop Wayk Den, and wait for all microservices to stop:

[source, sh]
----
PS > Stop-WaykDen
----

=== User Management

User using Wayk Now client can log in to be authenticated with Wayk Den Server. The server, by default, will provide a Wayk Den ID to any user who wants to connect to it. The server can be configured in a way forcing the user to be authenticated to accept a connection with the server. The command `Set-WaykDenConfig -LoginRequired True` can be used to force users to log in.

To authenticate user, Wayk Den can be configured to use a specific user group through LDAP integration. Two options are supported: Active Directory and JumpCloud. 

In order to fetch user and group information, a user with read-only LDAP access must first be created.

==== Active Directory

To integrate Active Directory, here are the information needed:

* LDAP server url: ldap://_server_ip_ 
* LDAP user credentials: username and password
* LDAP user group (optional)

It is important to specify the server IP since there is not DNS resolution in the docker container. The user used should be a user with only read-only access. A section below explains how to create a such user. Finally, the user group is not mandatory. If it is not specified, all users will be accepted. If it is specified, only users from that group will be able to be authenticated.

The following command will set LDAP property value for active directory. 

[source, sh]
----
Set-WaykDenConfig -LDAPServerType ActiveDirectory -LDAPUsername ldap-user@contoso.local -LDAPPassword ldap-password -LDAPServerUrl ldap://ldap-server -LDAPUserGroup 'Domain Users'
---- 

===== User creation with read-only access

By default, a new user created in active directory has read-only access on the LDAP server. But that user is also member of the group Domain Users by default. Being member of that group is enough to be able to use that user and log on any domain's computer. To avoid that, we suggest to use a user who is not a member of Domain Users group and has only read-only access on the LDAP server. To do that, a few steps is needed.

First, a new group has to be created, let's say "Read-only Users". Then a new user can be created and added only to that group. After that, the new group can be set as primary group for the user. And finally, the user can be removed from the Domain Users group. This user should be used to configured WaykDen Server.

==== JumpCloud

https://jumpcloud.com/[JumpCloud] is a cloud service who help you to centralize user management. You can create users and groups then use the service call "LDAP-as-a-Service" to access those users and groups from WaykDen. You can read more on https://support.jumpcloud.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2439911-using-jumpcloud-s-ldap-as-a-service[how to use JumpCloud's LDAP-as-a-Service]. 

To integrate Jump Cloud with Wayk Den, here are the information needed :

* LDAP server url : ldaps://ldap.jumpcloud.com:636
* LDAP user credential: username and password
* LDAP Base DN: Distinguised Name where to retrieve users and groups
* LDAP user group (optional)

The LDAP server url should be set to ldaps://ldap.jumpcloud.com:636. JumpCloud provide a non secure access as well, but we don't recommand it. A user who can read the ldap directory should be created following steps https://support.jumpcloud.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2439911-using-jumpcloud-s-ldap-as-a-service#createuser[here]. The username has to be provided with the Distinguished Name (DN), something like `uid=_LDAP_BINDING_USER_,ou=Users,o=_YOUR_ORG_ID_,dc=jumpcloud,dc=com`. The base DN is similar and should be set to `ou=Users,o=_YOUR_ORG_ID_,dc=jumpcloud,dc=com`. Finally, a user group name can be specified to limit user to that group.

The following command will set LDAP property value for JumpCloud.

[source, sh]
----
Set-WaykDenConfig -LDAPServerType JumpCloud -LDAPUsername "uid=ldap-user,ou=Users,o=YOUR_ORG_ID,dc=jumpcloud,dc=com" -LDAPPassword ldap-password -LDAPServerUrl ldaps://ldap.jumpcloud.com:636 -LDAPBaseDn "ou=Users,o=YOUR_ORG_ID,dc=jumpcloud,dc=com -LDAPUserGroup wayk-users"
----

==== Adding User/Removing Users
You can use `Add-WaykDenUser` to add users.
The required field are the Username and the Password and optionally you can set the Name and the Email of the user.

[source, sh]
----
 PS > Add-WaykDenUser -Username David - Password psw -Email david@devolutions.net -Name Jack
----

The use will be returned as a result.
[source, sh]
ID        : 5d83d2973766610100edd9ef
Username  : David
Name      : Jack
Email     : david@devolutions.net
LicenseID : 

If you want to remove that user, you can execute the command `Remove-WaykDenUser`, you have to specify the User Id to remove.

[source, sh]
 PS > Remove-WaykDenUser -ID 5d83d2973766610100edd9ef

==== Set User
Updates an existing WaykDen User with the command `Set-WaykDenUser`, the User Id is needed for this one, you can modify the Password, the Name and the Email

[source, sh]
PS > Set-WaykDenUser -UserID 5d851bc6373735010078cd8d -Password qwerty -Name NewName -Email newName@mail.net

==== Listing users
Once you have configured the server to integrate an LDAP server, it is possible to list all users, you can use `Get-WaykDenUser` to get users information.

[source, sh]
----
PS > Get-WaykDenUser

ID        : 5d2f7ed6de217e7817fc251d
Username  : user01@contoso.net
Name      : name
Email     : 
LicenseID :

ID        : 5d28acd25f8ccd7845dbfb38
Username  : user02@contoso.net
Name      : name
Email     : 
LicenseID :
----

You can also get information for a specific user if you specify the user ID or the username on the command

[source, sh]
----
PS > Get-WaykDenUser -Username user01@contoso.net

ID        : 5d2f7ed6de217e7817fc251d
Username  : user01@contoso.net
Name      : name
Email     : 
LicenseID :
----

You can also get user from a group  if you set the Group ID and optionnaly the User ID

[source, sh]
PS > Get-WaykDenUser -GroupID 5d83cca93766610100edd9ec

The result is the same thant the listing of users:

[source, sh]
ID        : 5d83c85b3766610100edd9e8
Username  : david
Name      : 
Email     : 
LicenseID : 
===
ID        : 5d83d4d93766610100edd9f0
Username  : Jdufaud
Name      : 
Email     : 
LicenseID 

==== Users synchronization

If a user is added to the LDAP server (Active Directory or JumpCloud), it will not be available in Wayk Den right away. A synchronization has to be done. Wayk Den will synchronized users on a regular basis, every 30 minutes. If you want to force a synchronisation, you can run `Sync-WaykDenUser`. After that command, the command `Get-WaykDenUser` can be run and all changes should be available. Note that if you have removed users in the LDAP server, those users will not be deleted from Wayk Den server because we want to keep user information of sessions.

==== Assigning User to Group
You can add a user to a group with the command `Set-WaykDenGroupMember`, this command need the Group ID and the User ID.

[source, sh]
PS > Set-WaykDenGroupMember -GroupID 5d83cca93766610100edd9ec -UserID 5d83d4d93766610100edd9f0

==== Remove User from group
You have the possibility to remove a user from a group with the command `Remove-WaykDenUserFromGroup` the Group ID and the User Id are needed for this one.

[source, sh]
PS > Remove-WaykDenUserFromGroup -GroupID 5d83cca93766610100edd9ec -UserID 5d83d4d93766610100edd9f0

==== Assigning Role to User
You can assign Role to User with the following command `Set-WaykDenRoleMember`, you need to give the ID of the User and the Role Name.

[source, sh]
PS >  Set-WaykDenRoleMember -UserID 5d83d4d93766610100edd9f0 -RoleName GuestRole

=== Group Management
==== Adding/Removing Groups
You can add group with the command `Add-WaykDenGroup` and the variable Group Name is needed for the name of the group.

[source, sh]
PS >  Add-WaykDenGroup -GroupName GuestGroup

The result will be the group previously created
[source, sh]
ID                       Name       RoleID
--                       ----       ------
5d83e0d13766610100edd9f2 GuestGroup 

You can also delete a group by the command
`Remove-WaykDenGroup`, The Group ID will be needed.

[source, sh]
PS >  Remove-WaykDenGroup -GroupID 5d83e0d13766610100edd9f2

==== Listing Groups
It is possible to list all groups, you can use `Get-WaykDenGroup` to get groups information.

[source, sh]
----
PS > Get-WaykDenGroup

ID                       Name           RoleID
--                       ----           ------
5d83cca93766610100edd9ec GuestGroup
----

==== Assigning Role to Groups
You can assign role to groups with the following command `Set-WaykDenRoleGroup`, you need to give the ID of the group and the Role Name to execute this one.

[source, sh]
PS >  Set-WaykDenRoleGroup -GroupID 5d83cca93766610100edd9ec -RoleName GuestRole

=== Role Management
==== Adding/Removing Roles
To Add Roles use the command `Add-WaykDenRole`, the Role Name is needed for this one.

[source, sh]
PS >  Add-WaykDenRole -RoleName GuestRole

The result is the created role:

[source, sh]
ID                       Name
--                       ----
5d83e2cc3766610100edd9f3 GuestRole

To Delete a role the command `Remove-WaykDenRole` is available with the parameter Role ID.

[source, sh]
PS >  Remove-WaykDenRole -RoleID 5d83e2cc3766610100edd9f3

==== Listing Roles
Use the command `Get-WaykDenRole` to list all the roles

[source, sh]
PS >  Get-WaykDenRole
ID                       Name
--                       ----
000000000000000000000000 admin
5d83e2cc3766610100edd9f3 GuestRole

=== License Management
Users need a license to do some operations. For instance, a license is required for a user who wants to open a session on a server. So you have to add licenses and assign them to your users if you want them to able to do operation requesting a license. There is one exception for site, country or global license and the last section describe the small difference for that kind of license. 

==== Adding/Removing licenses
Licenses can be added with the command `Add-WaykDenLicense`. You only have to specify the serial key to add it. The license ID will be returned as a result.

[source, sh]
----
PS > Add-WaykDenLicense -Serial XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
5d2ccce9653232010092c19f
----

Once it is added, you can visualized all licenses added with the command `Get-WaykDenLicense`. This command will show you all licenses added to the WaykDen server, including license information.

[source, sh]
----
PS > Get-WaykDenLicense

ID           : 5d2ccce9653232010092c19f
SerialNumber : XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
Expiration   : 2020-07-31 8:00:00 p.m.
Product      : WaykNow
Trial        : False
Count        : 1
Type         : None

ID           : 5d2cceb2653232010092c1a1

Count        : 10
Type         : None

ID           : 5d2ccebf653232010092c1a2
SerialNumber : XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
Expiration   : 2020-07-31 8:00:00 p.m.
Product      : WaykNow
Trial        : False
Count        : 1
Type         : Site
----

If you want to remove that license, you can do it with command `Remove-WaykDenLicense`. You only have to specify the license ID to remove.

[source, sh]
----
PS > Remove-WaykDenLicense -LicenseID 5d2ccce9653232010092c19f
----

==== Assigning licenses to users
Once you have added licenses, you have to assign those licenses to users. To do that, we use the command  `Set-WaykDenUserLicense`. You must specify the user ID or the username to identify the user and the license ID or the serial key to identify the license.
[source, sh]
----
PS > Set-WaykDenUserLicense -Username user@contoso.local -Serial XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX

PS > Set-WaykDenUserLicense -UserID 5d28acd15f8ccd7845dbfb1d -LicenseID 5d2ccea3653232010092c1a0
----

To be sure that the license has been assigned to your user, you can get the user information with the command `Get-WaykDenUser -Username _username_`

If the assignment doesn't work, verify if the license is already assigned to the maximum number of user. A license is valid for a specific number of user. Trying to assign a license to more user than that number will fail.

Finally, a license can be unassigned from a user with the command `Clear-WaykDenUserLicense` 

----
PS > Clear-WaykDenUserLicense -UserID 5d28acd15f8ccd7845dbfb1d
----

==== Site/Country/Global licensing
If you add a site, a country or a global license, you don't have to assign it to the users. Wayk Den server will consider all users licensed if a such license exist. Note that you will be able to assign that license to your users, but it is not mandatory.

== Usage

Many commands are available to manage the WaykDen server. All those commands required the WaykDen Url and the WaykDen Api Key since you can run them from any path on your system. So you can specify parameters `ServerUrl` and `ApiKey` on every command or you can use the command `Connect-WaykDen` to specify these values only once. Information will be kept in environment variables to be used for all future calls. 

[source, sh]
----
PS > Connect-WaykDen -ServerUrl https://den.ngrok.io -ApiKey 6ezyCcnsZIG6Fa7JpmZDdDLKUEG9yoDM
----

To simplify the connection, you can also run the command `Connect-WaykDen` in the same folder as your server configuration (WaykDen.db) without any parameters. Information from the WaykDen configuration will be used.

Once it is done, you should have two environment variables defined.

[source, sh]
----
PS > echo $env:DEN_SERVER_URL
https://den.ngrok.io
PS > echo $env:DEN_API_KEY
6ezyCcnsZIG6Fa7JpmZDdDLKUEG9yoDM

=== Connection management

==== Listing connections
It is possible to list all active user connections to your WaykDen server

[source, sh]
----
PS > Get-WaykDenConnection

ID           : b90345b3-e8a4-53ff-98d8-747eb9d026af
MachineName  : MachineName01
UserAgent    : WaykNow/3.3.0 (Linux; Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS)
UserID       : 5d28acd15f8ccd7845dbfb1d

Connected    : True
State        : ONLINE
LastSeen     : 2019-07-16 10:39:42 a.m.
----

It is also possible to list all offline user connections

[source, sh]
----
PS > Get-WaykDenConnection

ID           : 2839eaa7-640f-9e76-1f88-9769ee5320c8
MachineName  : MachineName02
UserAgent    : WaykNow/3.2.1 (Windows; Windows 10 Pro 1809)
UserID       : 5d28acd15f8ccd7845dbfb1d
DenID        : 898579
Connected    : False
State        : OFFLINE
LastSeen     : 2019-07-15 8:55:20 a.m.
----

An offline connection is a client who has already been connected to your server but who is not connected at that moment. Information is kept by the server to keep track of who has accessed your server.

Also, UserID could be empty if the WaykDen server doesn't requires the user to be logged. So as long as the user is not logged in the client, the field UserID will be empty.

Finally, as a side note, if you have some windows machine where WaykNow is installed with the msi package for the unattended access, two connections from that computer will be listed. That's normal since there is one connection that should be always online. The second connection is only the client connection.

=== Session management

Wayk Den server keep a trace of all sessions opened via the server. It is important to be aware that if you want to know who were involved in a session, user has to be logged in Wayk Now. To force user to be logged in, you can have a look to the parameter `LoginRequired` in the Wayk Den config explained in a previous section.

==== Listing sessions
It is possible to list all wayk sessions currently in progress. You will get information about the client and the server connected together.

[source, sh]

----

The field "EndedGracefully" indicate if you can trust the end time. If the session didn't end gracefully, it means that WaykDen server lost connection with client before the end of the session so the server doesn't know how much time the session continue after. The end time indicate the last time where the server was aware of that session. If the session ended gracefully, the end time indicate the real end time where the session has been stopped.

Similar to what we have in the connection information, the user information can be empty if no user is logged on the WaykNow client.

After a long period, the list of session terminated could be long. You can filter them by date by using the parameter `After` and/or `Before`

For example, this command will show you all sessions started in the last hour

Finally, since there is many fields displayed with a session, note that it is possible to filter and keep only fields that you want to see.

A lot of information is provided, but you can filter to keep only fields that you want to see.

==== Disconnecting sessions

Any session between two users can be stopped at any moment. It is as simple as using the command `Disconnect-WaykDenSession` and specify the session ID. The session ID can be retrieved with the command `Get-WaykDenSession` shown previously.

[source, sh]
----
PS > Disconnect-WaykDenSession -SessionID a99170f6-5895-4a4a-93e7-03321868e516
----

=== User management
==== Connect WaykDen User
The command `Connect-WaykDenUser` will start a user connection to the WaykDen , you can use the parameter -Force to force reconnect the actual user.

[source,sh]
----
PS ~/WaykNow-ps> Connect-WaykDenUser
"name" is now connected
----


==== Disconnect WaykDen User
The command `Disconnect-WaykDenUser` will logout your user on WaykDen.

[source,sh]
----
PS ~/WaykNow-ps> Disconnect-WaykDenUser

== Devolutions Jet

Devolutions Jet is a relay server for peer-to-peer connections. By default, jet.wayk.net:8080 is used by Wayk Den. But it is possible to use your own relay server and this section explains how. 

The Devolutions Jet service is not deployed with other Wayk Den services because it makes more sense for that service to be directly exposed in the cloud to get better performance.

That service is also available in a docker container. To launch that service, here is a docker command template that has to be used. 

[source, sh, subs="quotes"]
----
docker run -d --name devolutions-jet -e RUST_LOG=_log_level_ -e JET_INSTANCE=_jet_instance_ -p _port_:8080 devolutions/devolutions-jet: _jet_version_
----

In that command, a few parameters have to be set

- _log_level_: It can be 'error', 'info' or 'debug'. We recommand to set it to 'info'. By default, if RUST_LOG is not specified, the log level will be 'error'.

- _jet_version_: The jet version has to be changed to the specific version that you want to use. All versions are available on https://cloud.docker.com/u/devolutions/repository/docker/devolutions/devolutions-jet[dockerhub]. 

- _port_: The port uses can also be changed to the port that you prefer. Instead of `8080:8080`, you can change the parameter to `12345:8080` and the exposed port will be 12345. The second port 8080 is only the port number used inside the docker container and it has to be 8080.

- _jet_instance_: The JET_INSTANCE environment variable is used to specified the external URL for that specific Jet server. This address will be used by the WaykNow client to reach the relay server. If you have only one Jet server, the Devolutions Jet Server Url specified in the Wayk Den configuration will be the same as the jet instance value. However, if you want to deploy many jet servers, you can deployed a DNS load balancer who will forward requests to one of the jet server. In a such case, each jet server will specify their external address. It is needed because both peers in a connection has to reach the same jet server. So the WaykNow server will reach one server of the pool and send the jet instance information to the WaykNow client and the client will be able to reach the same Jet server.

Here is a command example to launch Devolutions Jet service

[source, sh]
----
docker run -d --name devolutions jet -e RUST_LOG=info -e JET_INSTANCE=jet.wayk.net -p 8080:8080 devolutions/devolutions-jet: 1.0.0-buster
----

To be sure that your Devolutions Jet server is running, you can run the command `docker logs devolutions-jet` where you should be able to see that your server is listening on the right port

[source, sh]
----

INFO 2019-08-07T15:32:20Z: devolutions_jet: TCP jet server started successfully. Listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
----

Once you have deployed a jet server, you can update the jet server parameter in your Wayk Den configuration with the command `Set-WaykDenConfig -JetServerUrl _jetServerUrl_`. After, your jet server will be used by WaykNow client to establish peer-to-peer connection.
